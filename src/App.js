        <div class="mt-[10%] w-[50%]">
          To set up this project, I installed Node.js and npm and then ran npx create-react-app "name" and followed the insallation for tailwindcss.
          This is very easy to do and there were very minimal difficulties as this is my prefered way to create web apps. Tailwind makes styling even easier.
